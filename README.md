# insurance_management_spa
Showcase SPA for insurance management, built end-to-end. Highlights modular React architecture, smooth animations, offline capabilities, and planned features like user roles, dashboards, report generation, and PWA support — demonstrating full-stack expertise and project ownership.

# 🛡️ Insurance Management Web App

## 🧭 Project Overview
**Insurance Management Web App** is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** designed and built entirely from scratch.  
The goal is to develop a **full-featured insurance management system**, including user authentication, data management, and automated report generation.  

This project is developed **entirely by me**, covering frontend architecture, UX design, backend logic, and data handling.

---

## 🚀 Current Progress
- 🏠 **Home page components** with responsive layout  
- 🌐 **Routing** via React Router  
- ✨ **Animations** and **CSS transitions** (global + local styles)  
- 🧩 **Modular component structure**:
  - `.jsx` — React components  
  - `.js` — supporting logic & data  
  - `.css` — separated into `base` and `effects` layers  

Currently optimized for desktop, **future plan: full responsiveness for all devices**.

## 📱 Offline Functionality
As a **SPA**, the app allows navigation and basic functionality **offline** after the initial load.  

**Planned PWA features:**
- Service Worker caching for offline usage  
- `manifest.json` for app installation on mobile/desktop  
- Background synchronization when online
